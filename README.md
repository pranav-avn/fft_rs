# fft_rs

fft_rs is a high-performance Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) library written in Rust. It leverages the Radix-2 FFT algorithm for efficient computation of discrete Fourier transforms.

## Features

- **Radix-2 FFT Algorithm**: Optimized for power-of-two input sizes.
- **High Performance**: Designed with Rust's safety and speed in mind.

## Todo
- [x] Implement Bit Reversal
- [x] Implement Butterfly Structure
- [x] Implement Twiddle Factor Calculation
